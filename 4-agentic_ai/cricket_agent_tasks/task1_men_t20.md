# Task 1: Cricket Agent for Men T20 Matches

## Objective
Create a cricket-specific agent web app (Streamlit) for men's T20 matches worldwide. The app should:
- Fetch and display live odds for men's T20 cricket matches

- Provide AI-powered analysis using cricket-specific personas
- Allow user to inspect raw data and analysis prompt

## Requirements
- Use a similar structure to `sports_agent.py`
- Focus only on men's T20 matches for this task
- UI should allow selection of T20 matches, show odds, news, and analysis
- Use cricket-specific analyst personas (e.g., Cricket Statistician, Ex-Player, Fan, Contrarian, etc.)
- All code and config for this task should be reversible by removing this folder

## Deliverables
- `cricket_agent.py` (initial version: men T20 only)
- This requirements file
- Any supporting files needed for this task

**Next steps:**
- Implement `cricket_agent.py` for men T20 matches only
